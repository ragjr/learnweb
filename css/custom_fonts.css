/* From Google's font site I retrieved a couple of fonts and font styles. It gave me a link to embed into my HTML head:

<link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Raleway:300,400|Shadows+Into+Light" rel="stylesheet">

I could also change some of the webservice call parameters if I want to include different weights later. I do need to ensure that the fonts actually have those properties in order to call them. For example, Shadows+Into+Light only has one property while Raleway contains a host of different styles.

<link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Raleway:100,200,300,400,800|Shadows+Into+Light" rel="stylesheet">


I also need to remember to change the stylesheet to this 'custom_fonts.css' since I'm calling these fonts in a new stylesheet.*/

h1 {

p {
